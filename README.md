**Things we have implemented that do not currently work:**
Our testing for the createAccount class is not currently working because the code was updated in another issue and the tests have not been updated yet. We do not have an interface to login and then access the menu of possible actions yet. This is something we're going to add in the next iteration, so for now, we are just providing you a script to test the majority of the code.
